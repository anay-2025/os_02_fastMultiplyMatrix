# Parallel vs Sequential Matrix Multiplication (C, fork())

## 📌 Overview

This project implements *square matrix multiplication (n × n)* in C using:

* ✅ Sequential execution (single process)
* ✅ Parallel execution using multiple child processes (fork())

The goal is to compare execution times and evaluate performance improvements when using process-based parallelism on multi-core systems.

The implementation uses the *naive O(n³) matrix multiplication algorithm* (no Strassen’s algorithm).

## 🚀 Features

* Dynamic allocation of large matrices (n ≥ 10,000 supported depending on RAM)
* Random matrix initialization using srand() and rand()
* Sequential multiplication
* Parallel row-wise multiplication using fork()
* Execution time measurement
* Performance comparison for different numbers of child processes
* Minimal virtual memory usage (dynamic allocation only)
